## 🎨 The 12 Carousel Variations

### 1. Full Width Hero Carousel
Full-bleed background images with centered text overlay, headline, subtitle, and a CTA button. Cinematic, immersive feel.

### 2. Split Layout — Left Text / Right Image
50/50 desktop layout (stacked on mobile). Left side has heading, paragraph, and button. Right side cycles through images with captions beneath.

### 3. Split Layout — Right Text / Left Image
Mirror of #2 with smooth fade transitions instead of slide animations for visual variety.

### 4. Card Style Carousel
Multi-card view with image on top, text below. Soft shadows, rounded corners, and hover scale effects. Shows 1 card on mobile, 3 on desktop.

### 5. Image Left / Text Right Per Slide
Horizontal layout per slide — 40% image, 60% text content. Clean editorial feel.

### 6. Glassmorphism Carousel
Full background image with a frosted-glass text container overlay. Backdrop blur and semi-transparent panels for a modern aesthetic.

### 7. Center Focus Carousel
The active slide is larger and prominent, with adjacent slides scaled down and slightly faded. Image + text stacked vertically.

### 8. Vertical Carousel
Slides transition vertically instead of horizontally. Image on top, text beneath. Unique scrolling feel.

### 9. 3D Perspective Carousel
Side slides have a slight CSS 3D rotation/perspective transform. Center slide is front-facing. Adds depth and dimensionality.

### 10. Luxury Minimal Carousel
Elegant serif typography, generous whitespace, refined text blocks. Apple-inspired minimalism with subtle fade transitions.

### 11. Dark Mode Neon Carousel
Dark background with glowing neon-colored borders and text accents. Image on the left, neon-styled text on the right. Cyberpunk-inspired.

### 12. Testimonial Style Carousel
Avatar image, large quote text, reviewer name and designation. Classic testimonial layout with smooth transitions.
